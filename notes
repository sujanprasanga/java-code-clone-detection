when we need to find stuff to compare from the editor we can get line numbers from there!

LOOP-> GOTO FOLOWED BY IF*

IF-> IF FOLOWED BY GOTO

cascaded if & loop ???

push ifs -> pop when jump to is reached!

variables are moved to top after compiling

need store & load to keep exception type & return for branches

if->throw, return, goto
