no line numbers needed!
when we need to find stuff to compare from the editor we can get line numbers from there!

LOOP-> GOTO FOLOWED BY IF*

IF-> IF FOLOWED BY GOTO

cascaded if & loop ???

push ifs -> pop when jump to is reached!

variables are moved to top after compiling

need store & load to keep exception type & return for branches

if->throw, return, goto

not recording stack and local vars since we do not need to know the exception type! - at least for the moment

for finally - there is an Exception table!

    Exception table:
       from    to  target type
           0    11    14   Class java/lang/Exception ; if exception occurs between 0-11 handled by 14
           0    21    27   any
